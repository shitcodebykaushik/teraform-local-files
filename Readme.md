# My Terraform Project

![Terraform Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashicorp/terraform-website/main/content/img/terraform-logo-2.svg)

This repository contains Terraform configurations to define and provision infrastructure as code.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of Terraform by managing a simple local file. It serves as a foundational example for understanding Terraform's core workflow: `init`, `plan`, `apply`, and state management.

While this specific example focuses on a local resource, the principles learned here are directly transferable to managing complex infrastructure on cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Defines infrastructure in declarative configuration files.
* **State Management:** Utilizes Terraform's state file to track and manage deployed resources.
* **Reproducibility:** Ensures consistent deployments across environments.
* **Dependency Locking:** Uses `.terraform.lock.hcl` to pin provider versions for reliability.
